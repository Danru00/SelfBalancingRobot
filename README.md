# SelfBalancingRobot
Two-wheeled self-balancing robot realized for the Robotics course at Polito, academic year 2022-2023. The simulation is based on ROS Noetic

# Run the Gazebo simulation
- Download the robot_assembly folder in your catkin workspace and run from a terminal: catkin_make
- Run from a terminal: roslaunch robot_assembly istagger_launch.launch
- After starting the simulation, the robot will initially fall. By rotating it upwards the PID controller will start working balancing the robot as prescribed
- You can tune the PID parameter by changing them in the Python file "pid_controller" under robot_assembly/src

# Run the Simscape simulation
- Download the Simscape folder
- Run the robot_assembly_simscape_DataFile in Matlab
- Open and run the robot_assembly.slx file to start the simulation
- You can tune the PID parameters changing them in the PID block

# Hardware implementation and Arduino code
- Guide to be done
